# Description

This repository contains notes and Haskell programs written for
studying [Types and Programming Languages](http://a.co/2c62ihn "Amazon") by
Benjamin Pierce.

The `implementations` folder holds a Stack project that currently has implementations for:

- untyped arithmetic expressions (Arith.hs, Chapter 3)
- pure untyped lambda calculus (Untyped.hs, Chapter 7)
- simply typed lambda calculus with base type boolean (SimpleBool.hs, Chapter 10)
